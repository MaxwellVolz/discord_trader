Here's a breakdown of what the code does:

Loads the API key, passphrase, and secret key from the .env file.
The generate_signature() method handles the creation of the signature string using HMAC SHA256 and then Base64 encoding it.
The connect() method is an asynchronous function that establishes the WebSocket connection. It passes the generated signature, timestamp, API key, and passphrase in the headers.
Remember to create a .env file in your project directory and include your API key, passphrase, and secret key like so:

makefile
Copy code
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
PASSPHRASE=your_passphrase_here
This is a basic example to get you started. You would extend the connect() method to handle incoming and outgoing messages as needed.
